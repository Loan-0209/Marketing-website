🎯 POWER GRID ANIMATION - REAL MAP ALIGNMENT FIX
===============================================

📋 UPDATED ELEMENTS:

✅ 500kV Lines (Red):
- 6 transmission lines với realistic angles
- Diagonal positioning to match real map layout
- Convergence patterns từ multiple directions  
- Rotation angles: -12°, -8°, -4°, -1°, +18°, +22°

✅ 220kV Lines (Blue):  
- 4 distribution lines với real connections
- Vertical và angled patterns
- Rotation angles: -15°, -25°, +8°, -45°
- Better coverage of substation connections

✅ 110kV Lines (Purple):
- 5 local distribution lines
- Curved và branch patterns
- Multiple orientations: -25°, +35°, -35°, +65°, -55°
- More realistic distribution network

✅ Infrastructure Labels:
- 500kV Substation: Repositioned to match map (35%, 25%)
- HEART Data Center: Center positioning (50%, 42%) 
- Hue Hi-Tech Park: Bottom-right area (15%, 20%)
- Future Substation: Added at (45%, 32%)

🔍 WHAT TO VERIFY:

1. Open: file:///Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/facilities.html
2. Navigate to "500kV Onsite Power Grid" section
3. Check animation alignment with real map features:
   - Red lines follow 500kV transmission paths
   - Blue lines connect substations và distribution points
   - Purple lines trace local distribution networks
4. Verify infrastructure labels positioned correctly
5. Test flow directions match real power transmission

🎯 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:

BEFORE: Simple horizontal lines, generic schematic
AFTER: Complex diagonal patterns, geographical accuracy

BEFORE: Mismatch với real infrastructure 
AFTER: Aligned với actual transmission routes

BEFORE: Limited coverage với basic patterns
AFTER: Comprehensive network với realistic flows

📊 TECHNICAL CHANGES:

- 23 total animation delays for staggered effects
- 15 transmission lines total (6x500kV, 4x220kV, 5x110kV)  
- Complex rotation transforms for realistic angles
- Geographical positioning based on real coordinates
- Enhanced visual coverage of entire map area

🚨 VERIFICATION POINTS:

If animations still don't align perfectly:
1. Note which specific lines need adjustment
2. Identify exact positioning issues
3. Report flow direction mismatches
4. Check infrastructure label accuracy

The system is now designed to match the real geographical layout instead of the simplified schematic diagram.

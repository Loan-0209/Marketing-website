# 3D Scene Loading Issue Fix Prompt

## Problem Description
My 3D scene renders correctly for about 2 seconds, then gets covered by a loading screen or there's a conflict in the loading logic. I need you to analyze and fix this issue.

## Analysis Request
Please examine my code and identify:

1. **Loading State Management Issues:**
   - Check for multiple loading states that might conflict
   - Look for race conditions between loading screen and 3D scene
   - Identify timing issues in state transitions

2. **3D Scene Initialization:**
   - Verify scene setup and rendering pipeline
   - Check if scene is being re-initialized or destroyed
   - Look for memory leaks or cleanup issues

3. **Async Operations:**
   - Check promise chains and async/await usage
   - Look for unhandled promises or missing error handling
   - Identify callback timing conflicts

## Specific Areas to Check

### Loading Logic
```
- Loading screen show/hide logic
- Scene ready state detection
- Asset loading completion tracking
- State management (useState, useEffect timing)
```

### 3D Scene Issues
```
- Three.js initialization sequence
- Canvas mounting/unmounting
- Animation loop conflicts
- Renderer disposal and cleanup
```

### Timing Issues
```
- useEffect dependency arrays
- Component mounting order
- Asset loading timeouts
- State update batching
```

## Fix Requirements

1. **Ensure proper loading sequence:**
   - Assets load → Loading screen shows
   - Scene initializes → Loading screen remains
   - Scene fully ready → Loading screen hides
   - No premature hiding or showing

2. **Implement proper cleanup:**
   - Dispose Three.js resources properly
   - Cancel ongoing operations on unmount
   - Clear timeouts and intervals

3. **Add debugging capabilities:**
   - Console logs for state transitions
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error boundaries

4. **State management fixes:**
   - Single source of truth for loading state
   - Proper state updates
   - Avoid state conflicts

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Loading state is managed consistently
- [ ] No race conditions in async operations
- [ ] Proper Three.js scene lifecycle
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance is optimized

## Expected Output
Please provide:
1. Identified root causes of the issue
2. Fixed code with explanations
3. Best practices for 3D scene loading
4. Debugging strategies for similar issues

## Additional Context
- Framework: [React/Vue/Vanilla JS]
- 3D Library: [Three.js/Babylon.js/etc]
- Build tool: [Vite/Webpack/etc]
- Any specific error messages or console logs

Please analyze the current implementation and provide a comprehensive fix for the loading screen conflict issue.# 3D Smart City Datacenter Water Infrastructure Analysis

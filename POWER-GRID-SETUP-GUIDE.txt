üéØ POWER GRID ANIMATION - SETUP GUIDE
=====================================

üìã WHAT'S BEEN ADDED:
- New Power Grid section in facilities.html
- Animated transmission lines (500kV, 220kV, 110kV)
- Power flow dots with realistic movement
- Interactive legend and infrastructure labels
- Grid statistics cards
- Responsive design for all devices

üîß SETUP STEPS:

1. SAVE THE IMAGE:
   - Save your power grid map image as: "power-grid-map.jpg"
   - Place it in: /Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/assets/images/
   - Make sure filename matches exactly: "power-grid-map.jpg"

2. OPEN THE PAGE:
   - Navigate to: file:///Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/facilities.html
   - Scroll down to see the new "500kV Onsite Power Grid" section
   - It appears above "Take a Virtual Tour"

üé® ANIMATION EFFECTS:

‚úÖ 500kV Lines (Red):
- Horizontal and diagonal transmission lines
- White dots with red borders flowing left to right
- 3-second animation cycles with different delays
- Glowing shadow effects

‚úÖ 220kV Lines (Blue): 
- Vertical and horizontal distribution lines
- White dots with blue borders
- Mixed horizontal and vertical flow patterns
- 3-second animation cycles

‚úÖ 110kV Lines (Purple/Pink):
- Local distribution lines
- White dots with purple borders  
- Curved and vertical flow patterns
- 3-second animation cycles

üè∑Ô∏è INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:

- Live Legend: Shows line types with colors
- Infrastructure Labels: HEART Data Center, Substations, Hi-Tech Park
- Grid Statistics: Capacity, reliability, connections
- Hover Effects: Stats cards lift on hover

üì± RESPONSIVE FEATURES:

- Desktop: Full animation with all effects
- Tablet: Optimized layout with reduced complexity
- Mobile: Simplified animations, stacked grid stats

üîç CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:

1. ADJUST ANIMATION SPEED:
   Change "animation-duration: 3s" to desired speed

2. MODIFY LINE POSITIONS:
   Edit top/left percentages in CSS classes:
   - .line-500kv.line-horizontal-1 { top: 25%; left: 5%; }
   - Adjust to match your actual map layout

3. CHANGE COLORS:
   - 500kV: #e74c3c (red)
   - 220kV: #3498db (blue)  
   - 110kV: #9b59b6 (purple)

4. ADD MORE LINES:
   Copy existing line HTML and CSS, adjust positioning

‚ö° POWER FLOW LOGIC:

- Dots represent power flow direction
- Multiple dots per line show continuous flow
- Delays create realistic staggered movement
- Glow effects emphasize high-voltage lines

üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:

When you open facilities.html, you should see:
1. New section titled "500kV Onsite Power Grid"
2. Your map image as background
3. Animated colored lines overlaying the transmission paths
4. Moving dots showing power flow direction
5. Legend explaining line types
6. Infrastructure labels marking key locations
7. Grid statistics below the map

üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING:

PROBLEM: Image not showing
SOLUTION: Check file path and name exactly matches "power-grid-map.jpg"

PROBLEM: Animations not working  
SOLUTION: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

PROBLEM: Lines not aligned with map
SOLUTION: Adjust CSS positioning percentages to match your map

PROBLEM: Mobile performance issues
SOLUTION: Animations automatically simplified on mobile

üìã FILE LOCATIONS:
- Main file: facilities.html (updated)
- Image location: assets/images/power-grid-map.jpg (you need to save this)
- All CSS included in facilities.html

‚úÖ READY TO TEST!
Save your image and open facilities.html to see the power grid in action!

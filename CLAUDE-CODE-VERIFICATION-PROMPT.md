Please verify the power grid animation implementation on the HEART website. Here's what needs to be checked:

## üéØ VERIFICATION TASKS:

### 1. FILE STRUCTURE CHECK
- Verify file exists: `/Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/assets/images/power-grid-map.jpg`
- Check if facilities.html contains the new power grid section
- Confirm CSS animations are properly implemented

### 2. WEBSITE FUNCTIONALITY TEST
- Open: `file:///Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/facilities.html`
- Navigate to "500kV Onsite Power Grid" section (should be above "Take a Virtual Tour")
- Verify the power grid map image displays correctly as background
- Check if animations are working:
  - Red lines (500kV): Horizontal flow with white dots moving left to right
  - Blue lines (220kV): Vertical and horizontal flow patterns
  - Purple lines (110kV): Curved flow patterns
  - All dots should have smooth 3-second animation cycles

### 3. VISUAL ELEMENTS VERIFICATION
- Grid legend should display in bottom-left corner with colored line samples
- Infrastructure labels should show: HEART Data Center, 500kV Substation, Hue Hi-Tech Park
- Grid statistics cards should display below the map with hover effects
- Responsive design should work on different screen sizes

### 4. PERFORMANCE CHECK
- Animations should be smooth without lag
- Page should load without console errors
- Mobile view should have simplified animations

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

If issues found:
1. **Image not showing**: Check file path and name exactly matches "power-grid-map.jpg"
2. **No animations**: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Animation positioning wrong**: The CSS positioning may need adjustment to match the actual map layout
4. **Performance issues**: Animations auto-simplify on mobile devices

## üìã EXPECTED RESULTS:

‚úÖ Power grid map displays as background
‚úÖ Three types of transmission lines with different colors and flow patterns
‚úÖ Smooth animation without performance issues
‚úÖ Interactive elements (legend, labels, stats) working properly
‚úÖ Responsive design across devices

## üêõ REPORT FINDINGS:

Please report:
- Whether all animations are working correctly
- If the image displays properly
- Any console errors or performance issues
- Suggestions for positioning adjustments if needed
- Overall assessment of the implementation

## üìÇ KEY FILES TO EXAMINE:
- `/Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/facilities.html`
- `/Users/thuyloan0209/Documents/Test_WEBSITE_2025.06.18/assets/images/power-grid-map.jpg`

The power grid section should create a professional, engaging visualization of the electrical infrastructure with realistic power flow animations.

## 🎯 Memory Usage Examples

### Store Project Information
```javascript
// Create entities for your project
create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "My Project",
    entityType: "software",
    observations: [
      "React-based web application",
      "Uses TypeScript for type safety",
      "Deployed on Vercel platform"
    ]
  }]
})

// Create relationships
create_relations({
  relations: [{
    from: "My Project",
    to: "React Framework", 
    relationType: "built_with"
  }]
})
```

### Search and Retrieve
```javascript
// Search for specific information
search_nodes({query: "authentication"})

// Read complete knowledge base
read_graph({})

// Access specific entity
open_nodes({names: ["HEART Technology Website"]})
```

## 🔧 Claude Desktop Integration

Complete configuration with all 3 MCP servers:

**Location**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 How to Use Memory MCP

### Automatic Memory
When configured with Claude Desktop, the memory system:
- **Automatically stores** important conversation details
- **Builds relationships** between discussed topics  
- **Retains context** across multiple conversations
- **Enables intelligent recall** of past information

### Manual Memory Management
You can also explicitly instruct memory operations:

```
"Remember that our HEART website uses admin/heart2024 credentials"

"Store the relationship that Playwright tests our authentication system"

"What do you remember about our news management features?"
```
